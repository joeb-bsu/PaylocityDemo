# Paylocity Challenge WebApp
Web app designed for a paylocity interview

This code is for a website that should allow a client to enter employees and their dependents into a database.

The program calculates the cost of benefits for employees and dependents, and applies those costs to a benefit
account maintained for that employee.  Costs may be discounted depending on the starting letter of the employee's
or dependent's name.  Costs are also prorated depending on the start date of employees, and add date of dependents.
